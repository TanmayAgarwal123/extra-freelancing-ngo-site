# Razorpay Integration Notes

For a complete Razorpay integration in a production environment, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Razorpay Account**:
   - Sign up at [https://razorpay.com/](https://razorpay.com/)
   - Complete the business verification process

2. **Get API Keys**:
   - Replace the test key `rzp_test_YourTestKey` in the Donate.tsx file with your actual test/live key
   - Test keys start with `rzp_test_` and live keys start with `rzp_live_`

3. **Server-side Integration**:
   - For complete security, implement server-side verification of payments
   - Create a backend API endpoint to verify payment signatures
   - Store donation records in a database after verification

4. **Webhook Integration**:
   - Set up webhooks in the Razorpay dashboard to get notified of payment events
   - Configure your server to handle these webhook events

5. **Compliance**:
   - Ensure your donation form follows payment processing compliance regulations
   - Include necessary terms and privacy policy links

6. **Testing**:
   - Use Razorpay's test mode to simulate payments before going live
   - Test various payment methods, failure scenarios, and edge cases

For detailed implementation guidelines, refer to the [Razorpay Documentation](https://razorpay.com/docs/).
